## RAGs

### About

This is a collection of RAGs (Retrieval Augmented Generation) models that I have created for different purposes.

### 1. The Jungle Book

This is a simple RAG model that uses Ollama to generate responses based on the embeddings of the text.

- [1_the_jungle_book.txt](1_the_jungle_book.txt)
- [1_the_jungle_book_rag_model.py](1_the_jungle_book_rag_model.py)
- [1_the_jungle_book_embeddings.json](1_the_jungle_book_embeddings.json)

To run the model, use the following command:

```bash
python rags/1_the_jungle_book_rag_model.py
```
